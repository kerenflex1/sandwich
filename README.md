# Olamo Investor Website

This repository contains an animated, single‑page pitch deck for **Olamo** – a platform that lets anyone turn their group chat into a living app. Speak inside your chat to create tools, launch stores, accept payments and collaborate without switching apps.

 The site showcases:
 - Hero section with globe background and voice waveform
 - Polished group chat demo where spoken requests spawn an interactive mini‑app
 - Problem and solution comparison
 - Features, impact statement, business model and market opportunity
 - Use of funds, roadmap timeline and team philosophy
 - Final investor call‑to‑action with deck download

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to explore the deck.

Minor update: chat demo enhanced with avatars and animated mini‑app.
