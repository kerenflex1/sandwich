# Olamo Investor Website

This repository contains an animated, single‑page pitch deck for **Olamo** – a platform that lets anyone turn their group chat into a living app. Speak inside your chat to create tools, launch stores, accept payments and collaborate without switching apps.

The site showcases:
- Hero section with globe background and voice waveform
- Simulated chat demo where spoken requests become mini‑apps
- Problem and solution comparison
- Features, impact statement, business model and market opportunity
- Use of funds, roadmap timeline and team philosophy
- Final investor call‑to‑action with deck download

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to explore the deck.

Minor update: README refreshed for demo.
